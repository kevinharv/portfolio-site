# portfolio-site

This site currently serves as a small bio and a link-tree for my contatct information. In the near future my goal is to expand the site to host personal projects that I have worked on and show off my programming prowess.

The site in it's current state is written entirely in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with Express.js running as the backend/hosting component. As of now, there is little in the way of interactivity, but I promise more is coming.
